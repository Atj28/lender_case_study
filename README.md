## General Information
-This project aims to analyze loan data to understand the factors influencing loan status, particularly focusing on defaults.
-The background involves assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers based on various financial indicators and personal demographics.
-The business problem being addressed is to provide insights into the key drivers of loan defaults, aiding lenders in making informed lending decisions.
-The dataset used for this analysis is a CSV file containing loan application data, with columns including loan amount, income, debt-to-income ratio, loan status, and other relevant factors.

## Conclusions
--The analysis identified several important driver variables influencing loan status, including income range, debt-to-income ratio, and employment status.
--A significant relationship was found between lower income ranges and higher default rates, indicating that borrowers in the lower income bracket are more likely to default on their loans.
--The verification status of borrowers also played a crucial role in determining loan outcomes, with verified incomes associated with lower default rates.
--The segmented analysis revealed distinct patterns in loan status based on different income ranges, highlighting the need for targeted lending strategies.-
